# Placeholder Project Hub

This repository contains the source code for a minimal project hub site hosted via GitHub Pages. It serves as a structured landing page with placeholder sections, allowing you to quickly publish a professional project presence while you prepare real content.

## Website Structure

The `index.html` file includes placeholders for all typical project components:

- **Header / Navigation:** Links for About, Roadmap, Team, Digital Assets, Contact, etc.
- **Hero Section:** A tagline and call‑to‑action buttons.
- **About Section:** A short description of the project's mission and values.
- **Digital Assets:** Card-style placeholders for assets such as logo packs, pitch decks, screenshots, demo videos, token/NFT artwork, and GitHub repository links.
- **Roadmap:** A timeline to illustrate milestones and upcoming releases.
- **Team:** Cards for team member photos, names, and roles.
- **Partners / Investors:** Placeholders for logos of partners or investors.
- **Whitepaper / Docs:** Links for downloading detailed documents or whitepapers.
- **Contact Section:** A simple form with email and social media placeholders.
- **Footer:** Space for legal or disclaimer text.

You can host your own content by replacing the placeholder text, images, and links with your own assets.

## Editing the Site

To customise the site:

1. **Clone the repository** and open `index.html` in a code editor.
2. **Replace placeholder text** (e.g., "Project Name", "Our mission statement…") with your project’s actual information.
3. **Insert real images and logos** by placing them in the repository (e.g., inside an `assets/` folder) and updating the `<img src="">` attributes.
4. **Update links** in the navigation and call‑to‑action buttons to point to real documents, contact pages or GitHub repositories.
5. **Adjust the roadmap** timeline to show your key milestones and dates.
6. **Fill out the team section** with names, roles, and photos of your team.
7. **Edit CSS**: The page uses simple Tailwind classes for styling. You can modify the classes or add a stylesheet to change colours, fonts and layout.

## Deployment

The site is served via GitHub Pages from the `main` branch. Any commits to `index.html` will trigger a rebuild of the site. To change the branch or folder used for GitHub Pages, visit the repository’s **Settings → Pages**.

## Future Improvements

This placeholder site provides a scaffolding; consider the following enhancements:

- **Custom Styling:** Create a custom CSS file or integrate a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap) to align the design with your brand.
- **Interactive Features:** Add JavaScript for modal pop‑ups, contact forms, or interactive animations.
- **Additional Sections:** Include FAQs, blog posts, or a newsletter sign‑up.
- **SEO & Meta Tags:** Update meta tags to improve search engine optimisation and social sharing.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure alt text on images and semantic HTML for better accessibility.
